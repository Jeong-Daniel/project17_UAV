## UAV ground detection and tracking systems  
Often a forest of trees has many different kinds of trees. In this project, we want to design a novel way to fly over a tree and determine what kind if tree it is, using a visual or biological sensor. Then, record the GPS point on the tree. At the end of a flight a map will show all of the GPS points for the specific variety of tree.


1.  The scope of the project should be set clearly.  
 Drone autopilot wasn't that simple in my experience. There are many conditions for flying drones.
As it’s almost impossible to fly drones in schools, we will go to a light aircraft runway managed by the Aerospace engineering department at the Yangsan campus of Pusan National University when we need to fly drones. I will handle to earn permission before using the place.
2.  Which technology to use  
TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, and so on. It hasn’t been decided yet because it depends on what kind of skills or functions are required to continue studying. I might add I’m used to using Python for programming  
3.  Which equipment to use.  
 We need to decide on embedded equipment, and I think Raspberry Pi is the best option. If we need to use drones together, other equipment would be considered as well.
